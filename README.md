# A simple Gulp setup

This is a lighter, slightly simplified version of budfy's Gulp setup.
You can check it out here: https://github.com/budfy/Easy-webdev-startpack

## Purpose

This setup is mainly for doing layouts from Figma or other such software. There are no PHP, FTP and .ttf files as I don't usually need them for such projects.
